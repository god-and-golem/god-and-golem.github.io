# God and Golem
<pre>
  The game of Creator with his Creation.

  Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves
  before Yahweh, and the Adversary also came among them.
  Yahweh said to the Prosecutor, ‘Where have you come from?’
  The Prosecutor answered Yahweh and said, ‘From roaming through the 
  earth and going back and forth upon it.’
  Yahweh said to the Prosecutor, ‘Have you given thought to my servant Job?
  Truly there is no one like him on earth, a blameless and upright man,
  one who fears God and shuns evil!’
  The Prosecutor answered Yahweh and said, ‘Does Job fear God for nothing?
  Are you not the one who put a fence around him and his house and all 
  that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands,
  so that his possessions are spread throughout the earth! But stretch out
  your hand now and strike all he has, and he will surely curse you
  to your face!’
  Yahweh said to the Prosecutor, ‘Very well, then, all that he has is in
  your hand; but against him do not stretch out your hand!’

I decided to start where the previous Man ended.
